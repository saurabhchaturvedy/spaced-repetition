# To Do

Note: Some "todo stuff" can also be found in the comments spread throughout the codebase. The goal is to eventually
reduce such spread and concentrate as much high-level todo's here as possible.

* # Use postgres now() function instead of datetime's now in functions.py
* Normalize the database
* When inserting entry, if source entered is not valid, ask for the source again instead of making user start all over again
